## Case Characteristics

Our automated method for identifying cases of SUID from medical examiner
archives generated 333 prospective cases. After comparison with the gold
standard list of cases identified via manual review by a panel of
experts, we added XXX cases and removed XXX cases (Table XXX). There
were XXX cases not originally identified by manual review that we still
deemed to be valid. This process yielded XXX valid SUID cases in total.

We tabulated descriptive characteristics for valid SUID cases (Table
XXX). We compared the distributions of select characteristics compared
to those in the overall population of Cook County children under the age
of 5 (derived from the census). SUID cases had a higher prevalence of
Black infants and favored location in Chicago (vs.Â Cook County Suburbs)
compared to the reference population.

## Census Tract Aggregate Characteristics

We tabulated characteristics of census tracts that had at least one case
of SUID versus those that did not (Table XXX). Census tracts with at
least one case of SUID appeared to have higher proportions of black
people, XXX and lower proportions of XXX.
